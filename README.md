# Chrono Vault: A C++ Time-Travel Dungeon Crawler

**Chrono Vault** is a console-based dungeon crawler game written in C++. Explore a randomly generated 10x10 maze, collect time crystals, avoid traps, and use a unique time-rewind mechanic to undo mistakes. This project showcases advanced C++ concepts like stack-based state management, file I/O for high-score persistence, and dynamic dungeon generation, making it a fun game and a valuable learning tool.

## Features
- **Random Dungeons**: Navigate a 10x10 grid with walls ('#'), crystals ('C'), and traps ('T').
- **Time Rewind**: Undo up to 5 moves at the cost of energy, adding strategic depth.
- **Energy System**: Collect crystals to restore energy; moving and rewinding consume it.
- **High Score**: Persistent high-score tracking based on crystals collected.
- **Simple Controls**: Use WASD to move, 'r' to rewind time, 'q' to quit.

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <your-repo-url>`
2. Compile the game: `g++ ChronoVault.cpp -o ChronoVault`
3. Run the game: `./ChronoVault` (Linux/Mac) or `ChronoVault.exe` (Windows)
4. Move with WASD to collect Crystals ('C'), avoid Traps ('T'), and navigate around Walls ('#').
5. Use 'r' to rewind time if you hit a trap or make a mistake (costs energy).
6. Survive as long as possible to maximize your score; high score is saved automatically.
